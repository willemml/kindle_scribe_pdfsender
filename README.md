# Kindle Scribe PDF Sender

Automator script that converts PDFs to Kindle Scribe annotatable format without an internet connection.

Requires that [Kindle Create](https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Create/b?ie=UTF8&node=18292298011) is installed as well as [calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com) and the calibre [KFX Output plugin](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=272407).

If the Kindle is connected to the computer the converted PDF will be automatically added to it's documents folder.
